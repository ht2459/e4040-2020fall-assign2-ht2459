Other important considerations include how to select good initialization values for ANN parameters, and how to avoid overfitting. This task addresses some of the regularization methods, such as **Dropout** and **Batch Normalization**. You are going to implement them in NumPy."

You need to keep updating your CNN in iterations to get the best possible result. Kaggle will enable you to observe the progress made by students in the class. You can use any/all of the deep learning modelling techiques (e.g. regularization, optimization) to get the best possible performance. You have to use TensorFlow 2.2 to build your model."
